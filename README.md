# Skin Disease Detector

This project is a **skin disease classification web application** built with **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow**.  
It uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect eight types of common skin diseases from an image captured via webcam or uploaded manually.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts skin diseases from images using a trained CNN model.
- Supports both image uploads and real-time webcam capture.
- Displays the prediction along with the model's confidence percentage.
- Alerts if no visible disease is detected (based on a confidence threshold).
- Simple and intuitive UI built with Streamlit.
